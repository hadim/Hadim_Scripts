# Fiji Scripts
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hadim/fiji_scripts.svg?branch=stable)](https://travis-ci.org/hadim/fiji_scripts)

A set of scripts for Fiji.

Use it, hack it, share it.

## Usage

#### Add the `Hadim` update site 

- Go to `Help ▶ Update Fiji`.
- In the new window, click on `Manage update sites`.
- Scroll to find `Hadim` in the column `Name`. Click on it.
- Click `Close` and then `Apply changes`.

#### Open the scripts

- Click on `File ▶ New ▶ Script...`
- The Script Editor window will open.
- Scripts are available in `Templates ▶ Hadim Scripts`.

## `ij2_tools`

The package also contains a [Python library](src/main/resources/ij2_tools) for ImageJ.

## Deployment 

Package deployment is made with Travis. Only the `stable` branch is built and pushed to the `Hadim` personal update site. However those branches are very often synced together.
